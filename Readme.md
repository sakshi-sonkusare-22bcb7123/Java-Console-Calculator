# üêß Java Console Calculator ‚Äì Task 1 (August 2025)

In this task, I built a **console-based calculator** in Java to strengthen my understanding of **Java syntax**, **method-based programming**, and **logical flow**.  

My goal was to design a simple but reliable program that could perform **multiple arithmetic operations** while using **modular methods** for clean code organization. I wanted the calculator to feel interactive through a looping menu and handle mathematical edge cases like division by zero, negative square roots, and overflow scenarios.

## ü¶ï What‚Äôs Inside?

In this project, I implemented:
- **Six arithmetic operations** (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Power, and Square Root)  
- A **menu-driven structure** to let users perform multiple operations without restarting the program  
- **Edge case handling** for situations like divide-by-zero and negative inputs in square roots  
- **Overflow checks** to prevent results from exceeding data type limits  
- A single global `Scanner` object for user input, keeping resource usage minimal

## ü™º Core Features Covered

### (^‚ñΩ^) Arithmetic Operations
- Addition of up to 25 integers  
- Sequential subtraction  
- Multiplication with overflow guard  
- Division with divide-by-zero check  
- Power (x^y) using `Math.pow`  
- Square root with negative number restriction  

### (^^„Çû Program Flow & Design
- Menu-driven loop for continuous operation  
- Separate methods for each operation  
- Single global `Scanner` object for all input  
- Overflow handling for extreme values
